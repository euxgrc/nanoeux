  <div>
    Was there a lifetime waiting for us
In a world where I was yours?
Paper planes and porcelain
Smell of rain through the window pane
And the sight of you
Oh, you were a good dream
  </div>
  <div>
  I was scared to lose you then
But secrets turn into regrets
Buried feelings grow
Oh, you were a good dream
  </div>
