### There is no growth in the comfort zone and no comfort in the growth zone.

I was always afraid of the unknown. It scares me when I do not know the things around me. But I came to realize that the thought of fear itself is greater than what it is we fear. 

We all have fear. It is innate to us as humans. This is a comforting reminder that everybody is just as scared as how you feel about the unknown. You just have to choose whether you’re going to let this fear hold you back, or whether you’re going to run toward it.
