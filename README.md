<h2 style="font-family:Candara;font-size:40px;color:red;text-align:center">The World Outside My Comfort Zone</h2> 

<em style="font-family:Candara;font-size:20px;color:red;text-align:center;">There is no growth in the comfort zone and no comfort in the growth zone.</em>

<p>I was always afraid of the unknown. It scares me when I do not know the things around me. But I came to realize that the thought of fear itself is greater than what it is we fear.</p>

<p>We all have fear. It is innate to us as humans. This is a comforting reminder that everybody is just as scared as how you feel about the unknown. You just have to choose whether you’re going to let this fear hold you back, or whether you’re going to run toward it.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px;font-family:Quiska">Leap of Faith</h1>

<p>I am starting this space to do something different and discover more about myself. I want to have this time to really appreciate the little things in life. To find happiness in taking risk and face challenges confidently.</p> 

<p>Nothing will change if you will not take any action.</p>
<em>One step at a time, Little by little.</em>
<p>Explore the world and find a new world outside.</p>
